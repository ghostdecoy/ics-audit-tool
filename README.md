# ics-audit-tool
a little script I put together to health check and audit workstations in ICS environments

Key Checks:
- Domain join status
- Time sync (NTP)
- Local Admin enabling
- ICS operator AD group membership
- USB storage policy enforcement
- RDP NLA
- Banner notice for login compliance

- Originally built for application-layer ICS defense engineers to use during field assessments and audits.
